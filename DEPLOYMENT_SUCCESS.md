# 🎉 Deployment Successful!

## Services Running

✅ **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
✅ **Frontend UI**: http://localhost:9000
✅ **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/api/health

## Container Status

```
certbot-ui-backend   - Running on port 5000 (Healthy)
certbot-ui-frontend  - Running on port 9000 (Healthy)
```

## Access the Application

1. **Open your browser** to: http://localhost:9000

2. **Login with default credentials**:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

3. **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Change your password immediately after first login!

## What's Working

- ✅ Full-stack application running
- ✅ Backend API with Express + TypeScript
- ✅ Frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Docker containers healthy
- ✅ WebSocket support for real-time updates
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)
- ✅ Input validation with Zod
- ✅ Certbot integration

## Testing the Application

### 1. Test the Backend API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Certbot availability
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health/certbot
```

### 2. Test the Frontend

Open http://localhost:9000 in your browser and log in.

### 3. Check Logs

```bash
# Backend logs
docker compose logs backend

# Frontend logs
docker compose logs frontend

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Stop services
docker compose down

# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up -d --build

# View container status
docker compose ps

# Access container shell
docker compose exec backend sh
docker compose exec frontend sh
```

## Port Configuration

**Note**: Port 3000, 3001, and 8080 were already in use, so the frontend is running on port 9000.

To change the port, edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
frontend:
  ports:
    - "YOUR_PORT:80"  # Change YOUR_PORT to your preferred port
```

Then restart:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access the UI
- Check containers are running: `docker compose ps`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs frontend`
- Verify port 9000 is not blocked by firewall

### Backend errors
- Check Certbot is installed: `docker compose exec backend certbot --version`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs backend`
- Verify environment variables in `.env`

### Certificate operations fail
- Ensure ports 80/443 are available (for standalone plugin)
- Check Certbot has proper permissions
- Review logs in the UI or: `docker compose logs backend`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Change default password (Settings page)
2. ✅ Try obtaining a test certificate (use staging environment)
3. ✅ Explore the dashboard and features
4. 📖 Read [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for detailed usage guide
5. 🔒 Review security settings before production use

## Security Reminders

- [ ] Change default password
- [ ] Set secure JWT_SECRET in .env
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Review CORS settings
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Set up proper authentication for production
